Responsible for managing the camera and lighting, they oversee the selection and manipulation of technical equipment to create striking images on screen.The visual impact of a project is driven by the creative choices a cinematographer makes. These guys make the big decisions about the use of different lenses, filters, lighting techniques and camera movements to create dramatic effect and prompt different emotional responses from the audience. They\u2019re also responsible for making decisions about aspect ratio, digital effects, image contrast, and frame rates.Cinematographers get involved throughout the entire production lifecycle. Before filming starts, they dissect the screenplay, conduct extra research into different styles and motifs which relate to the subject matter of the script, and liaise with the Multimedia Adviser and Content Creators to discuss their creative ideas.The next step involves meticulously planning the technical execution of each shot. They also figure out what equipment and staff will be required. They are then responsible for handling the procurement of equipment and other technical production specialists. Throughout this process, cinematographers need to be mindful of budget restrictions and time constraints.During filming, cinematographers run the show, directing the technical production crew and making sure the correct lenses, filters, cranes, Steadicams, dollies and lights are used for each shot.Post-production, cinematographers work alongside directors and editors to make sure the colour grading of the film or TV show is spot on.Apply",
